# 👋 Hey, I’m Will

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a student, software engineer, and entrepreneur - always building, always learning.

Currently, I'm a junior at the University of Denver, splitting my time between classes, developing for two companies, and leading my own startup. I’m passionate about creating tools that make everyday systems smarter, faster, and more intuitive.

### 🤖 Stratus Code

`Agentic code review and PR assistance for GitHub`

Stratus Code is a GitHub App that brings AI-powered code review and interactive help directly to your pull requests and issues. It raises quality without adding process drag.

**What it does**

* 🔍 Automated PR reviews: triggers on `opened`, `reopened`, and new commits, evaluates diffs, flags issues, and posts inline comments with actionable fixes.
* 💬 Mention-based assistance: mention `@stratus-code` in any PR or issue to ask questions, request changes, or get guidance grounded in repo and conversation context.
* 🧭 Agentic context gathering: automatically pulls relevant files, diffs, and related threads to answer accurately.
* 🛠️ Optional auto-fix: when enabled, commits small scoped fixes to the PR branch so you stay focused on the hard parts.
* ✅ Check run integration: publishes checks with clear summaries, confidence, and a code health snapshot.
* 🎯 Structured and reliable: JSON Schema constrained outputs, type-safe architecture, and easy model swaps or custom behavior.

**Great for**

* Teams that want consistent review coverage at speed
* Projects that need higher signal on every PR
* Developers who want an AI pair programmer inside GitHub

**Built on**
